This project is a simple calculator web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator, while CSS is applied to design a clean and user-friendly interface. JavaScript handles the core functionality of the calculator, including input processing and calculation logic. DOM manipulation is used to update the display dynamically as users interact with the buttons. Event listeners manage both button clicks and keyboard inputs for smooth interaction. The equal button evaluates the entered expression and displays the result instantly. Error handling is included to manage invalid expressions and division by zero. The calculator also supports keyboard actions like Enter, Backspace, and Escape. Overall, this project helps in strengthening fundamental front-end development and JavaScript skills.
